# NEAR Certified Developer (NCD) - Day 0

Curated list of things you need to have ready before you attend [NCD I](https://hackmd.io/@nearly-learning/ncd-1-1d) and [NCD II](https://hackmd.io/@nearly-learning/ncd-1-1d) to succeed

## What you **must** have installed

Software that you **must** have installed in your computer in order to be able to work on content discussed in NCD I and II.

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - to get sample projects from GitHub to your computer and to later share your project with others
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - to install 3rd party libraries to sample project you downloaded from GitHub
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) - (reccomended) - basically, this is more user friendly version of npm and our npm scripts are using yarn
- [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup) - to deploy your first smart contract
- Code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or any other favorite (you will have hard time coding if you don't have the code editor)

## What you **should** know

Technologies you should know before attending NCD I and NCD II, without this you will have hard time understanding what we are teaching.

By the way, you are still welcomed to attend NCD courses but without this, you won't be able to create demos and get the certification.

- [HTML Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - to create UI
- [JavaScript Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - to handle logic of your smart contract
